# 🎛️ DJ Mixing App

A modular DJ mixing tool built in C++ using JUCE, designed for an Object-Oriented Programming modules and shaped by real DJ workflow experience.

## 🧠 Concept

This project explores how to translate hardware-based DJ workflows into a mouse-driven software interface.  Instead of recreating a full professional DJ suite the focus was on **clean architecture**, **intuitive interaction**, and **faithful modelling of DJ behaviours** such as cueing, loading tracks to specific decks, tempo control, and waveform navigation.

The result is a lightweight but expressive mixing tool with two decks, a functional library/ import system, waveform visualisation, and interaction patterns inspired directly by physical DJ gear.

## 🧩 My Role

- Designed the class architecture (Decks, Transport, Library, Waverform, Mixer controls)
- Implemented playback controls: cue, play/ pause, seek, tempo, volume/ fade
- Built a track library with import flow and 'load to Deck 1/ Deck 2' interactions
- Added waveform visualisation with click-to-seek and drag-to-set-start behaviour
- Implemented a cue-button system that mirrors real DJ hardware logic
- Added simple NLP-style parsing to infer artist/ title metadata from filenames

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

C++ • JUCE • Object-Oriented Programming • Audio playback • GUI components • Basic text parsing

## 🔧 Process

### Goal

To build a modular, extensible DJ app that demonstrates strong OOP design and feels natural to someone used to physical DJ equipment, even when controlled with a single mouse pointer.

### Constraints

- Mouse-only interaction (no multi-touch, no MIDI controllers)
- Limited audio-programming experience at the time
- Project scoped to academic module
- Need to keep architecture clean and maintainbable

### Approach

- Broke ap into modulear components with clear responsibilities
- Used JUCE for audio playback and GUI layout
- Designed tempo and volume controls to behave like DJ faders
- Implemented a library import system with metadata extraction
- Added waveform visualisation with draggable playhead
- Modelled cue-button behaviour after real hardware:
  - When track is stopped:
     - Press-and-hold Cue plays track temporarily
     - Release Cue stops playback and returns to cue point
     - 'Pressing' Play while holding Cue continues playback from that point
  - When track is playing:
     - Cue behaves differently, matching hardware conventions
     - Prevents accidental cueing during playback

### Key Decisions

- Prioritised interaction fidelity over adding advanced audio features
- Focused on real DJ workflows rather than generic media-player controls
- Built the import + metadata parsing as a foundation for richer library
- Kept architecture modular to support future expansion

## ⭐ Reflections

### What worked

- A clear, modular class structure as evidenced by 92% grade for coursework
- Hardware-inspired interactions that feel familiar to DJs
- Functional library/ import system with metadata parsing
- Waveform visualisation that supports intuitive navigation

### What I'd improve

- Further separation of UI and logic for clear extensibility
- More robust metadata parsing and library management
- Additional visual feedback (levels, cues, deck status)
- Future expansion into looping, cue points, or effects (once audio programming skills deepen)

### What I learned

- How to architect a real-time audio application using OOP principles
- How JUCE strctures audio + GUI components
- Challenges of translating two-handed hardware workflows into mouse-only interactions
- Importance of designing from real user practice rather than abstract UI ideas
