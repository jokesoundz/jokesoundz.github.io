# 👁️ VR Interaction Prototype

Modular VR interaction prototype built with Unity 6 using the 3d Universal Rendering Pipeline.  Exploring gaze-based interaction, accessible navigation, and early universal-design principles.

## 🧠 Concept

This prototype explores how VR interactions can be made intuitive, comfortable and accessible.  It combines gaze-based interaction, animated feedback, spatial audio cues, and multiple navigation modes, including locomotion and teleportation with vignettes, to reduce simulator sickness.

The name of the project is 'Reality is Blurry' and the long-term goal is to evolve this into a game that raises awareness of visual impairment and includes features that support players with low vision.

## 🧩 My Role
- Built gaze-based interaction using XR Interaction Toolkit
- Added animated and audio feedback to reinforce user intent
- Implemented locomtion, teleportation, and vignette-based comfort settings
- Designed interaction logic with modularity and accessibilty in mind
- Prototyped early universal-design features for low-vision players
- Debugged collider issues, timing prbolems, and intraction edge cases
